# Adventure-Works
An end-to-end Power BI analytics solution that transforms 269,720 global transactions  into actionable business intelligence for Maven Market. 

#### Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end business intelligence solution designed to transform raw transactional data into a strategic tool for the AdventureWorks leadership team. 
By moving through the full BI lifecycle—data transformation, relational modeling, and advanced DAX—I turned a massive dataset into a high-performance engine that tracks $24.9M in total revenue and $10.5M in total profit.

#### The Business Problem
AdventureWorks operated at a massive scale, processing 25.2K total orders across North America, Europe, and the Pacific. 
However, management lacked a real-time way to monitor critical KPIs like their 2.2% return rate or understand the demographic drivers of their 17.4K unique customers. 
Decisions were reactive rather than proactive.

#### The Solution
I built a robust star-schema model to handle global transactional data, focusing on three core areas of impact:

#### Revenue & Growth Intelligence
I implemented time-series analysis to track monthly performance against historical benchmarks.
- Monthly Momentum: In the final month of the data, revenue reached $1.83M , representing +3.31% growth over the previous month.
- Efficiency Metrics: I authored DAX measures to track Revenue Per Customer, which currently stands at $1,431.

#### Operational Risk & Product Performance
The dashboard identifies "profit leaks" by highlighting high-return categories.
- Return Analysis: While Tires and Tubes drive the highest order volume , I isolated Shorts as the most returned product type.
- Top Performers: The Water Bottle - 30 oz. emerged as a high-velocity item with 3,983 orders generating $39,755.33 in revenue.

#### Customer & Demographic Profiling
I integrated demographic slicing to help the marketing team refine their targeting.
- Income & Occupation: Data shows that customers in the "Average" income bracket (11.6K orders) and those in "Professional" occupations (7.9K orders)  are the primary revenue drivers.
- Loyalty Leaders: The report identifies high-value individuals like Mr. Maurice Shan, who contributed $12.41K in revenue across 6 orders.

#### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Data Modeling: Built a Star Schema with 1:Many relationships to optimize filtering and performance.
- Advanced DAX: Created complex measures for MoM growth, moving averages, and revenue targets.
- Data Visualization: Designed a multi-page interactive report with drill-throughs and geographic mapping.
